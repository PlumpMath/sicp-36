These files are my (mathias) solutions to the exercises in the introductory programming
class Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP).  The full text
of the book is available at [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)

Forked from [http://github.com/plural/sicp](http://github.com/plural/sicp) and started my own branch with my own solutions.
