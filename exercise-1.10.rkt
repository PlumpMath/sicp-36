; The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann's function.

(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))

(A 3 3)
; Answer: 65536 

; Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
; computes 2n

(define (g n) (A 1 n))
; computes 2^n
; example: (A 1 10) = 2^10 = 1024

(define (h n) (A 2 n))
; computes 2^(h (n-1)) 
; example (h 1) = 2^(h 0) = 2^0 = 2
; example (h 2) = 2^(h 1) = 2^2 = 4
; example (h 3) = 2^(h 2) = 2^4 = 16

(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
; computes 5 * n^2
